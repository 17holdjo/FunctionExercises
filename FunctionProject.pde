//Your assignment is to write a program that moves something in a random walk. Any sort of random walk is fine. 
//You could use your penguin, favicon, you may find it easier to move a simpler object like an ellipse or a point.
//You could also move an image, see the image() function in the API to get started.
//Once you've choosen what picture or object you want, make sure you can see it on the screen.
//Then make sure you can move your image or picture by changing it's x and y coordinates.
//Since the x and y coordinates of the picture or object will be changing, we will need variables for each.
//In void draw(), change the variables that hold the x and y coordinates a small amount using random.
